1. fix bugs for with the convex hull of a point set when the result geometry  is null

from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point,MultiPoint
#Generate M candidate sites with the convex hull of a point set
    '''
    Input:
        points: a Numpy array with shape of (N,2)
        M: the number of candidate sites to generate
    Return:
        sites: a Numpy array with shape of (M,2)
    '''
    hull = ConvexHull(points)
    polygon_points = points[hull.vertices]
    poly = Polygon(polygon_points)
    
Solution:    
    poly = MultiPoint(points).convex_hull
